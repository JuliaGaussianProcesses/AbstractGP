# AbstractGPs.jl

*Abstract types and methods for Gaussian Processes.*

AbstractGPs.jl is a package that defines a low-level API for working with Gaussian processes (GPs), and basic functionality for working with them in the simplest cases. While it is aimed more at developers and researchers who are interested in using it as a building block than end-users of GPs, much can be achieved with it as an end-user.
